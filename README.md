# Python Interpreter in Javascript
Just a small Python Interpreter written in ES6 Javascript. Try it out by forking and then changing the `test.pyjs` file!

If any further development is done on this project, it could be used as a Python package for the web! Feel free to [start a pull request](https://github.com/RayhanADev/Python-Compiler/pulls) and work on it!
